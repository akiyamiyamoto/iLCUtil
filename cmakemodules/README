Description:
------------
These cmake modules are needed to build the ilcsoft tools with cmake.
Most of them are Find<PackageName>.cmake files that set the appropriate
variables for include files and libraries in order to build with the given 
Package.

They need to be installed, i.e. available on your system.



There are also 2 macros available in the following files:

MacroLoadPackage.cmake:
-----------------------

    LOAD_PACKAGE( Package_Name [QUIET] [REQUIRED] [LINK_ONLY] [NOACTION] )


    Description:
    ------------
    this macro loads an ILC Software Package, i.e.:
    when the macro LOAD_PACKAGE( PkgName ) is called, CMake first checks if
    the variable <PkgName>_HOME is defined. If so, it tries to find a file
    named <PkgName>Config.cmake in the path defined by this variable, if it
    doesn't find it, it tries instead to find a cmake "Find" module named
    after the package (Find<PkgName>.cmake) in the path defined by the variable
    CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. If one of these files is found, CMake will check if the
    is correctly installed by executing the file. After a successful check
    a couple of variables (<PkgName>_INCLUDE_DIRS, <PkgName>_LIBRARIES,
    <PkgName>_DEFINITIONS) will be set in order to use the package... The
    macro LOAD_PACKAGE is aware of these variables and automatically uses them
    for "loading" the package. For a more controled behaviour you can
    additionally pass some parameters to the macro which in turn are
    passed to the <PkgName>Config.cmake or Find<PkgName>.cmake modules.
    For more information on the parameters check the MacroLoadPackage.cmake
    file itself.
    

MacroCheckDeps.cmake:
-----------------------

    CHECK_DEPS()
    
    
    Description:
    ------------
    this macro reads the following cmake variables of one project:
        + BUILD_WITH
        + LINK_WITH
        + ${PROJECT_NAME}_DEPENDS
    and calls LOAD_PACKAGE for each package defined in these variables.
    
    see below the table of arguments passed to LOAD_PACKAGE for each
    variable:

                            | QUIET | REQUIRED | LINK_ONLY | NOACTION
    ------------------------|-------|----------|-----------|----------
    BUILD_WITH              |       |     x    |           |
    ------------------------|-------|----------|-----------|----------
    LINK_WITH               |       |     x    |     x     |
    ------------------------|-------|----------|-----------|----------
    ${PROJECT_NAME}_DEPENDS |       |     x    |           |
    ------------------------|-------|----------|-----------|----------
